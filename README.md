# Java OOP & Data Structures Practice

This repository contains **Java practice code and coursework** developed during Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) courses.

It covers core Java concepts, classical data structures, and problem-solving exercises implemented from scratch.

## 📌 Topics Covered

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

  * Classes & Objects
  * Inheritance
  * Encapsulation
  * Polymorphism
* Data Structures

  * Stack
  * Queue
  * Linked List
* Algorithms & Problem Solving

  * Expression evaluation
  * Infix → Postfix conversion
* Java Fundamentals

  * File I/O
  * Methods & control flow
* Basic GUI

  * Java Swing (Panels, Frames)

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each `.java` file represents an **independent lab, assignment, or practice exercise**, including:

* `Stack.java`, `Queue.java`, `Node.java` — custom data structure implementations
* `JavaLinkedListDemo.java` — linked list usage
* `ExpressionConverter.java`, `InfixToPostfixDemo.java`, `ExpressionEvaluator.java` — expression parsing & evaluation
* `InheritanceDemo.java` — OOP inheritance example
* `GUIwithPanels.java`, `MyFrame*.java` — basic Swing GUI practice
* File handling demos using `Scanner` and file streams

## ⚠️ Important Note

Some files were uploaded **as originally submitted for coursework**.

👉 In a few cases, **the public class name inside the file may not exactly match the file name**.

To run a file:

* Either rename the file to match the public class name
* Or rename the public class to match the file name

This was intentionally left unchanged to preserve the original academic submissions.

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
javac FileName.java
java ClassName
```

(Java 8+ recommended)

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is meant to:

* Demonstrate understanding of **Java OOP and DSA fundamentals**
* Showcase **problem-solving skills in Java**
* Serve as a reference for academic and interview preparation
