# Java OOP & Data Structures Practice

This repository contains **Java practice code and coursework** developed during Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) courses.

It covers core Java concepts, classical data structures, and problem-solving exercises implemented from scratch.

## 📌 Topics Covered

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes & Objects  
- Inheritance  
- Encapsulation  
- Polymorphism  

### Data Structures
- Stack  
- Queue  
- Linked List  

### Algorithms & Problem Solving
- Expression evaluation  
- Infix → Postfix conversion  

### Java Fundamentals
- File I/O  
- Methods & control flow  

### Basic GUI
- Java Swing (Panels, Frames)  

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each `.java` file represents an **independent lab, assignment, or practice exercise**, including:

- `Stack.java`, `Queue.java`, `Node.java` — custom data structure implementations  
- `JavaLinkedListDemo.java` — linked list usage  
- `ExpressionConverter.java`, `InfixToPostfixDemo.java`, `ExpressionEvaluator.java` — expression parsing & evaluation  
- `InheritanceDemo.java` — OOP inheritance example  
- `GUIwithPanels.java`, `MyFrame*.java` — basic Swing GUI practice  
- File handling demos using `Scanner` and file streams  

## ⚠️ Important Note

Some files were uploaded **as originally submitted for coursework**.

In a few cases, **the public class name inside the file may not exactly match the file name**.

To run a file:
- Either rename the file to match the public class name  
- Or rename the public class to match the file name  

This was intentionally left unchanged to preserve the original academic submissions.

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
javac FileName.java
java ClassName
````

(Java 8+ recommended)

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is meant to:

* Demonstrate understanding of **Java OOP and DSA fundamentals**
* Showcase **problem-solving skills in Java**
* Serve as a reference for academic and interview preparation
